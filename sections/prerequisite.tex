\subsection{Prompt Processing Architecture}

The energy consumption analysis compares three different prompt processing
approaches.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An \gls{slm} run on the GPU.
    \item An \gls{nlm} run on the GPU.
    \item A custom \gls{nlp} based model run on the CPU.
\end{enumerate}

The reason for running the methods on different architectures, stems from their
different practical implementations. Due to the relative complexity of
\glspl{slm}, it was decided to run it on the GPU, utilising its capabilities of
larger computational complexity. Initial testing supported this choice, as the
\gls{slm} experienced significant performance improvements running on the GPU,
compared to the CPU. The \gls{nlp} approach is much simpler, allowing it to run
on the CPU, and gaining no significant benefit by being run on the GPU. The
\gls{nlm} exists in an area between the other options. However, preliminary
testing shows that there is no significant difference in prompt processing
speeds depending on the architecture in our specific testing environment,
therefore it was chosen to run on the GPU, to be a closer comparison to the
\gls{slm}.
